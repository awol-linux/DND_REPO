# Room one on the way in
```
 You walk into a room. It is erly silent in the room on the far end you see a archway leading to another chamber.
 The room smells unusual for the dungeon there is no stench of rot or mold rather it is a clean smell a breath of fresh air down in the dungeon. 
 Along the wall you see many frames. As you take a closer look a chill goes through your back you see they contain manicaled arms or legs.
```

* There are 20 total frames each one is a straight unarmed strike `+4` attack and `1d4` damage.  
    
* It is not magical rather undead. so effects like toll undead will work on it.


# Main room. 

    As you walk into the room you look around. 
    The room has for archways on top of the one directly in front of you is the work MUST to your left is I to the right is BE.
    In the middle of the room you see a a sword standing upright, hilt down in pile of stone.

* The sword is the only thing magical in the room. If they try to take the sword without tying themselves to it the room starts spinning. the following is the order of what happens if they try to take the sword without tying themselves to it.

*  If the players Look around inside the room they will see that on the top of the door they entered is the word `bound`

* The trap ends when the sword is bound to a player.

As soon as they touch the sword they get locked in

    As you touch the sword to take it. it drops down a few inches. 
    your hear a click and then a slam. You realize the door you came in from just slammed shut. 

Everyone rolls inititive. On inititave roll 19 the trap starts to activate
    
* Players should make  a constitution save (dc 14) to not be dizzy. (have to decide specific effect. if not just disadventage on all skill checks. advantage on dex saving throws)

* if a player tryes to move at the speed of the room that is a athletic or acrobatic check (dc 9).

On initive 9 the sword starts to become an issue.

    You see the sword start to extent it gets longer about 9 feet or so.
    It then starts to bend it goes across the room till it reaches the wall.

At this point the players will need to do something to avoid the damage. each player take 0 longsword attack at the start of their turn

* Dispel magic (dc 19) will prevent the sword from changing sizes. however it also makes it a non magical sword from there out
# Room 0 on the way out

    You look back into the room you came in from. There are limbs strewn about the floor and broken glass everywhere

As they walk through there are a total of 19 darts with `+1` `1d4+1` each   
# Room 1

    As you walk into the chmaber to your {side} you see there are 3 stone gargoile fountans. 
    two on each wall it is almost as if they can talk to each other

Past the first tile is a pressure plate. when they press down on it the fountains will change to an acid spray constitution saving throw (dc 9) `1d10+2 ` acid damage per gargoile.

* The trap has a DC 14 investigation or dc20 perception
* Any attempt to disarm it is a dc 14 on a failed attempt the trap goes off.

# Room 2

    As you walk into the next room you see a flight of stairs. It seems to go up to a upper level above the sword

* The stairs are actually part illusion. If they go up the stairs they will see a false floor (dc14 wisom) to fall back into the room with the sword.

* On a fall they make a dex saving throw. If they make it. then they are hanging above the sword. For every turn they are there they have to make a athletics or acrobatics saving throw (dc9) to not get hit

# Room 3
